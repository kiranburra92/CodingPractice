 * Consider an undirected graph where each edge weighs 6 units. Each of the nodes is labeled consecutively from 1 to n.

 * You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of edges describing an undirected
 * graph. After you create a representation of the graph, you must determine and report the shortest distance to each
 * of the other nodes from a given starting position using the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). Return an array
 * of distances from the start node in node number order. If a node is unreachable, return  for that node.
