 * one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two
 * adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * <p>
 * Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount
 * of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
